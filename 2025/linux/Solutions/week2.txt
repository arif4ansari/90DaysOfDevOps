Hands-on Linux Administration 🐧🔥

This week, I worked on user management, file permissions, log analysis, process monitoring, and automation! 💻🚀

1️⃣ User & Group Management
✅ Created a new user and added them to a group
✅ Set a password and granted sudo access
✅ Restricted SSH login for specific users
📌 Commands Used:
💻 sudo useradd devops_user
💻 sudo passwd devops_user
💻 sudo groupadd devops_team
💻 sudo usermod -aG devops_team devops_user
💻 sudo usermod -aG sudo devops_user
💻 echo "DenyUsers restricted_user" | sudo tee -a /etc/ssh/sshd_config
💻 sudo systemctl restart sshd

2️⃣ File & Directory Permissions
✅ Created a directory and file
✅ Set Owner: edit, Group: read, Others: no access
✅ Verified permissions
📌 Commands Used:
💻 mkdir /devops_workspace
💻 touch /devops_workspace/project_notes.txt
💻 chmod 640 /devops_workspace/project_notes.txt
💻 ls -l /devops_workspace

3️⃣ Log File Analysis (AWK, Grep & Sed)
✅ Analyzed logs using grep, awk, and sed
✅ Extracted errors, timestamps, and replaced sensitive data
📌 Commands Used:
💻 grep -i "error" Linux_2k.log
💻 awk '{print $1, $2, $3}' Linux_2k.log
💻 sed -E 's/[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+/[REDACTED]/g' Linux_2k.log
💻 awk '{print $0}' Linux_2k.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10

4️⃣ Volume Management & Disk Usage
✅ Created and mounted a volume
✅ Verified disk usage
📌 Commands Used:
💻 mkdir /mnt/devops_data
💻 sudo mount /dev/xvdf /mnt/devops_data
💻 df -h
💻 mount | grep devops_data

5️⃣ Process Management & Monitoring
✅ Started and monitored a background process
✅ Killed and verified process termination
📌 Commands Used:
💻 ping google.com > ping_test.log &
💻 ps aux | grep ping
💻 top
💻 htop
💻 kill -9 <PID>

6️⃣ Automating Backups with Shell Scripting
✅ Created a backup script and scheduled it using cron
✅ Added a success message in green text
📌 Commands Used:
💻 echo -e "\e[32mBackup Completed Successfully!\e[0m"
💻 tar -czf /backups/backup_$(date +%F).tar.gz /devops_workspace
💻 crontab -e # Scheduled the backup
